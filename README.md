# Mix-or-Match Memory Game
This is a Memory game with HTML, CSS and JS.
# Description
> The game randomly shuffles the cards. A user wins once all cards have successfully been matched.

> Game timer: when the player starts a game, a displayed timer should also start and timer is 100 second. Once the player wins the game, the timer stops.

> When a user wins the game, a modal appears to congratulate the player and ask if they want to play again. It also tells the user how much time it took to win the game.

# Features
> The number of cards on screen chages with difficulty. The cards are always different because the icons are pulled form an array.
